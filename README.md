# Algorithms-for-Decision-Making

This repository contains all of the files for the two R Markdown projects from the Algorithms for Decision Making course in Fall 2015.

The BirthsAnalysis file uses the ncbirths.csv data set. It was the midterm project for the course.

The TitanicAnalysis file uses the Titanic.csv data set. Due to the incomplete nature of the data, the code for the Support Vector Machines doesn't always work depending on which rows are used. It was the final project for the course.

Both projects were done in a team of three.
